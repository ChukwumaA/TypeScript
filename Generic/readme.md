    Generics are code templates that you can define and reuse throughout your codebase. They provide a way to tell functions, classes, or interfaces what type you want to use when you call it. You can think about this in the same way that arguments are passed to a function, except a generic enables you to tell the component what type it should expect at the time it's called.

    we need to create generic functions when your code is a function or class that:
     - works with a variety of data types.
     - uses the data type in severl places.

   Generics can 
    - Provide more flexibilty when working with types.
    - Enable code reuse
    - Reduce the need to use the "any"  type.

Why use Generics, check out the index.ts in the Generics folder.
